It's been a while since I last touched anything related to code. It was back in my high school years where I got to join multiple courses where I learned basic problem solving skills and languages such as Java.  My freshman year in high school I was able to have fun with a program called Scratch, which is a block-based visual programming language. Anyone who is curious about coding should really check it out. Then my sophmore and junior years I joined computer science courses where I learned the programming language java. I enjoyed these two years and was able to make friends who have the same interest and to this day they are in a similar track as me. My last year in senior year I took app development and was able to create an application for my school. I decided to study software engineering because it's something that I enjoy and want to continue learning.Anyone can learn a programming language but that can get you so far in coding beacause there will be times where a problem might arise and you need to be able to problem solve as well. With experience you and I will be able to solve these problems that we encouter each day.  Recently I got a family member to start studying sotfware engineering and with dedication they can go a long way to becoming a successful software engineer. I too strive to become successful and enjoy the ride. Flatiron is the best place to make connections and enjoy talking about similar interests.
